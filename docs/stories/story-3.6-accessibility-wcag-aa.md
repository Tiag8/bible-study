## 📖 Story

As a user with visual or motor impairments, I want Bible Study to be accessible using keyboard navigation, screen readers, and high contrast so that I can use the app like any other user.

  - Run Lighthouse accessibility audit
  - Score must be 95+ (or fix all flagged issues)
  - Check all pages: Dashboard, Editor, Graph, Settings

- [ ] **Color + Icon for Status (No Color-Only Indicators)**

## 🔧 Dev Notes

**Component Updates Needed:**
- Dashboard: Status badges (study, tags)
- Editor: Toolbar buttons (need labels)
- Backlog: Status indicators
- Graph: Node labels (accessibility)
- Modals: Focus trap, focus restore

**Status Indicator Example:**
```tsx
// ❌ BEFORE (color-only)
<div className="w-4 h-4 bg-green-500" />

// ✅ AFTER (color + icon + text)
<div className="flex items-center gap-2">
  <CheckCircle className="w-5 h-5 text-green-600" />
  <span className="text-green-700 font-medium">Concluído</span>
</div>
```

**ARIA Label Examples:**
```tsx
// Button
<button aria-label="Deletar estudo">
  <Trash className="w-5 h-5" />
</button>

// Form input
<label htmlFor="book-select">Livro</label>
<select id="book-select">...</select>

// Image (decorative)
<img src="icon.svg" alt="" />

// Image (informative)
<img src="chart.png" alt="Gráfico de progresso de estudos" />
```

**Testing Tools:**
- Lighthouse (browser devtools)
- axe DevTools (browser extension)
- Screen reader: VoiceOver (Mac/iPad)
- Keyboard navigation: Tab through entire app

**Related Stories:**
- Story 3.5: Mobile UX (touch targets already 44px+)
- Story 3.7: Toast accessibility (ARIA live regions)

**Browser Testing:**
- Chrome (primary, for Lighthouse)
- iPad (VoiceOver testing)
